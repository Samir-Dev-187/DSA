This repository contains my personal collection of code for Data Structures And Algorithms (DSA). All the code in this repository is based on the comprehensive DSA lecture series by Shradha Khapra from the Apna College Youtube channel.

Repository Stucture:

This code is organized into two main folders:
-> Chapters: Contains code implementions corresponding to each specific topic and chapter covered in the cource.

-> Interview Questions: Includes solutions to various practice problems from Leetcode and coding challenges relevant for interviews.

This serves as a personal log of my learning journey.
